# Admin-Utilities-Management-System-in-Bash-Script
This project creates a menu-driven admin utilities system using Bash scripting. It manages tasks such as monitoring system metrics (CPU, memory, and disk usage), displaying system information, and handling user login with a passcode. The script includes modular code, email alerts, and error handling for an efficient administrative interface.
